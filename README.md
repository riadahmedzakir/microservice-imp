# Learning microservice architecture 

Replicating identity micro service with JWT token based authentication

    # Role based authentication
    # Role base data access
    # Adding new feature on the go to learn in deapths

## Done so far
        # Implemented Identityserver4 to get Token
        # Multi tenant/client from datbase as configurables
        # Working with custom claims from tenant User
        # Custom Role based authorization
        # Roles are configurable from dabase.
        # Each action uses CustomAuthorizeAttribute to check request permission from database as configurable
## To do
        # Implement password hashing
        # Create client/tenant to create and login with user.
        # Create a second client/tenant to check security and configurablity
        # Take default identityserver4 token to custom controller.
        # Change token encryption from symetric to asemtetric.
